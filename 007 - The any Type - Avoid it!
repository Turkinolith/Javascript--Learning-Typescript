	*** type: any ***
	*****************
Its a type, just like "string" or "boolean"
Means TS has no idea what this is. It can't check for correct property references.

* Avoid variables with "any" at all costs! *
The whole idea behind TS is all the types and that by having them defined it allows TS to catch errors inside of the code.
If TS knows the different types it can look at any time we call a function on an object or reference a property on an object and
figure out if I'm referencing something properly or if its something I made a typo on.

So, any time there is a value with type any TS can not do any error checking at all around that value.
