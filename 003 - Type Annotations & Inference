**** Type Annotations & Type Inference ****
*******************************************

They apply slightly differently to Variables, functions and objects.

Type Annotation - Code we add to tell Typescript what type of value a variable will refer to.

Type Inference - Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to.


Type Annotations (Developers tell Typescript the type <-------> Type Inference (Typescript guesses the type)
