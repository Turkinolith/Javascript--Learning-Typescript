**** Course Overview ****
*************************

When learning typescript there are 2 distinct categories of knowledge needed:

#1 - Syntax & Features
	- What is an interface?
	- What is the syntax for defining an interface?

#2 - Design Patterns with TS
	- How do we use interfaces to write reusable code?

**Instructor wanted to focus on design patterns, but realized you just have to get the boring syntax out of the way first to set up for doing design patterns.

Course Goal:

------ Syntax & Features ------
Understand basic types in TS
Function typing & annotations
Type definition files
Arrays in TS
Modules systems
Classes & Refresher on OOP
