**** Destructuring with Annotations ****
****************************************

lets imagine we have an object that describes todays weather. its possibly got a date to indicate todays date and the current weather outside.
That will probably be a string.

	const todaysWeather = {
		date: new Date(),
		weather: 'sunny'
	};

Now lets create a function that will take the forecast and log out the weather and as such it takes a weather object as the argument.

I need to annotate the argument type there with an object literal just like before.

	const logWeather = (forecast: {date: Date, weather: string }): void => {
		console.log(forecast.date);
		console.log(forecast.weather);
	}

	logWeather(todaysWeather);


One optimization is to use some ES6 syntax and destructure the date and weather properties out of the variable.
Instead of refering to forecast.date and forecast.weather I pust pull the properties off directly inside the argument list.

Normal syntax would be:
	const logWeather = ({ date, weather }) => {
	  console.log(date);
	  console.log(weather);
	}


So, how to do this in TS with type annotations?
Replace the variable itself with the actual destructuring statement.

	const logWeather = ({ date, weather }: {date: Date, weather: string }): void => {
		console.log(date);
		console.log(weather);
	}


Note, that I did not try to stick the annotation types along with the destructuring portion. They will always be 2 separate statements separated by the colon.

And here is the same thing, but with array destructuring. note in the annotations I don't work with the variable names, just the types.

	const logArr = ([varone, vartwo]: [number, number]): void => {
		console.log(varone);
		console.log(vartwo);
	}

And in this version vartwo is a string, varone is a number.
	const logArr = ([varone, vartwo]: [number, string]): void => {
		console.log(varone);
		console.log(vartwo);
	}
